# tic-tac-toe

1. This modular type of programming really, especially the article provided in the project.
It is the separate of concern. https://www.ayweb.dev/blog/building-a-house-from-the-inside-out

2. Set the event handler for each button cell. Actually can be set to the board with the dataset info.

3. Pop up dialog need to prevent default behavior from happening, otherwise it seems refresh the page.

4. Only button type='submit', the required attribute in html start to kick in.

5. containerDiv.textContent = '', set the container textContent to '', can delete all the sub nodes inside.

6. The first time I think about this tic tac toe, I really mainly thinking about the UI stuff, how to response the click event and place the token in the cell specifically. But actually we refresh the board every time we place the token, I didn't think that way in the first place.
